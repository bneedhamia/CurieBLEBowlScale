# CurieBLEBowlScale
This project is an Arduino 101 (Curie) Dog water or food bowl continuous weight scale that sends results via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).  The measured weight can be read by any standard BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) application.

The blog about this project begins at https://needhamia.com/?p=880

This project is a follow-on to the Dog Bed Scale, [CurieBLEWeightMonitor](https://github.com/bneedhamia/CurieBLEWeightMonitor). 
## Status
The scale is painted and calibrated. I'm now working on the Raspberry Pi gateway Node.js code.
