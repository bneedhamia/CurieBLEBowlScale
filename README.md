# CurieBLEBowlScale
An Arduino 101 (Curie) Dog water or food bowl continuous weight scale that sends results via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).  The measured weight can be read by any standard BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) application.

This project is a follow-on to the Dog Bed Scale, [CurieBLEWeightMonitor](https://github.com/bneedhamia/CurieBLEWeightMonitor). 
## Status
I'm just now starting to make notes about the design - it's far from usable.
