# CurieBLEBowlScale
When complete, this will be an Arduino 101 (Curie) Dog water or food bowl continuous weight scale that sends results via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).  The measured weight can be read by any standard BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) application.

This project is a follow-on to the Dog Bed Scale, [CurieBLEWeightMonitor](https://github.com/bneedhamia/CurieBLEWeightMonitor). 
## Status
I have the initial mechanical design and parts list. Next steps: assemble the mechanical and electrical parts, then write the software.
